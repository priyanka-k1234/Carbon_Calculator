# Carbon_Calculator

Carbon Footprint Monitoring Tool using python

This GitHub repository contains the code for a Carbon Footprint Monitoring Tool developed in Python. The tool allows users to input data related to energy usage, waste emissions, and business travel, and calculates their carbon emissions in kilograms of CO2. The program provides options to calculate carbon emissions for each category individually or all together, generating a bar chart visualization to represent the carbon emissions breakdown.

The tool utilizes a class called "CarbonCalculator" which handles the input validation and performs the necessary calculations. It also includes a function called "generate_pie_chart" that generates the pie chart using the Matplotlib library.

The main function serves as the entry point of the program and provides a user-friendly menu interface for the users to select the desired calculations. It loops until the user chooses to exit the program.

This repository serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in monitoring and managing their carbon footprint. The code can be easily understood and modified for specific needs. It can also be integrated into larger sustainability projects or used as a starting point for further development and optimization.

Overall, this Carbon Footprint Monitoring Tool provides a practical solution for individuals and organizations to track their carbon emissions and make informed decisions to reduce their environmental impact.
